# Seq2Seq LSTM model - Translate and Predict

The encoder-decoder model provides a pattern for using recurrent neural networks to address challenging sequence-to-sequence prediction problems such as machine translation.

Encoder-decoder models can be developed in the Keras Python deep learning library and an example of a neural machine translation system developed with this model has been described on the Keras blog, with sample code distributed with the Keras project.

This example can provide the basis for developing encoder-decoder LSTM models for your own sequence-to-sequence prediction problems.
